                <p>In geosciences minerals are defined as solid compounds formed naturally, that is, by geological processes described by natural forces that shape the physical constitution of a planet, moon, asteroid, comet or interplanetary dust.</p>

                  <p>Minerals have a crystalline structure, that is, they have an ordered internal arrangement of their atoms, ions or molecules, which in turn constitute the repeating units or building blocks of a mineral. These building blocks form symmetrical patterns that repeat in three dimensions throughout the solid composite. They are called unit cells, which when repeated several times three-dimensionally, form a macroscopic crystal, better said, visible to the naked eye. That is: the unit cell represents the fundamental unit of a mineral, its smallest part.</p>  
                  <p>Thus we can define that a crystal is a structure formed by an uncountable number of small identical building blocks arranged three-dimensionally, whose size depends on the amount of blocks available. Here we can make an analogy to LEGO® plastic blocks, where different objects are created by fitting one block to another. In the case of minerals, the blocks have a submicroscopic dimension, that is, atomic. Imagine that each LEGO® block is also made up of countless small blocks stacked in order, up, down and side to side, until they form the biggest block.
                </p>
                  <p>The blocks and atoms within each block are repeated in familiar patterns defined by geometric symmetry operations. These patterns make the crystals show various types of shapes. Crystallography is the science that studies how these blocks and the atoms that compose them are arranged in solid materials.</p>  
                    
                  <p>Only compounds of inorganic origin are considered minerals. Similar compounds, but of organic origin, are difficult to distinguish. For example, the calcium phosphate (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)) that forms our teeth is of biological origin, and is absolutely identical to the mineral apatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)). It is also possible to synthesize an apatite-like compound in the laboratory, but in this case the compound is described as synthetic calcium phosphate. Often this synthetic material is also described as synthetic apatite. However, biological and synthetic calcium phosphates are not considered minerals by definition.</p>
